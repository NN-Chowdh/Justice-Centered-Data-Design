## Questions / Difficulties

Reflect on 2-3 questions about difficulties or concerns in the list format below. Think of questions that you would like your peers to address.

1. **Relative Path**: I still find file paths confusing. Even though I managed to write them, if I look back later, I have trouble understanding how I figured them out.. 
2. **Image link**: Same thing goes for the image link actually. I finished all the task two days ago but while i was checking it again today I couldn't clearly explain how I did them.
