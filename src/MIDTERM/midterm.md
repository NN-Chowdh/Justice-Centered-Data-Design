# "Book Publication Data Analysis"

- **Name**: Nazifa Chowdhury
- **Dataset**: BooksDataset

## Overview

I chose the book publication dataset because it contains a comprehensive collection of over 100,000 published books with detailed metadata that seemed most manageable among the three dataset options. 

The dataset includes rich information for each book: titles, authors, detailed descriptions, genre categories, publishers, publication dates, and pricing data. With over 100,000 records, this dataset offers the scale needed to identify meaningful statistical patterns in publishing industry trends, popular genres, and market dynamics that wouldn't be visible in smaller datasets.

```js
import {utcParse,utcFormat} from "d3-time-format";
```
